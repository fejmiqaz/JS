Create a web page where upon loading the page, div elements are displayed, loaded from a JSON, with properties from the JSON, at random positions on the screen. 
The screen should be 800x800. 
When an element is clicked, it grows, and then four small cubes appear from it, moving in fixed directions — meaning, the two on the left should move apart, and the other two on the right should move apart with animation. 
Then, if any of those new cubes are clicked, the same animation should repeat for the new square — it should grow and then split into 4 new ones.
